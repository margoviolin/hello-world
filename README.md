I'm Margaret from Ukrain.
It's my third day of learning computer siencies.
I'm professional violin player, but I want my brain to work better. And maybe I can learn some interesting information from IT.
From my first two days I learned a bit about HTML, CSS and JS. 
But it's only start. I need at least a month to make it work. Let's see what is next!
